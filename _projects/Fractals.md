# Fractals
My interest with fractals started in 2017 when I was staying at my grandparents', and found an old book of fractals. Finding Daniel Shiffman's [*Nature of Code*](https://natureofcode.com/) website and [*The Coding Train*](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain) YouTube channel prompted me to start writing my own fractal renderers. This post will be a lightning fast review of these renderers and other related experiments.

## Early Fractal Renderers

Mandelbrot renderers, 2017 (C#, Java, Processing).
My very first attempt used C# and .NET libraries, and was as clunky as it could possibly have been. I then moved onto the more suitable Processing library for Java that I continued to use for many other projects.

I'm keen to explore using shaders to and signed distance fields in my next iteration.
