I'm a Computer Science grad (University of Cambridge, 2022) and software engineer based in the UK. Python and C++ are my current workhorses.

I am currently working on Bassoon (my toy programming language), training RNNs to generate cricket commentary, and building a web app to (hopefully) help you find your favourite song *ever**†.

I am interested in natural language processing, programming languages and compilers, as well as algorithmic art (no such thing as too many fractals) and CTF challenges.

If you don’t find me at the computer, I’ll be playing cricket in the summer, running in the winter, or maybe I’ll finally be tackling that triathlon... Otherwise I enjoy playing and creating computer games and fiddling with my 3D printer.
